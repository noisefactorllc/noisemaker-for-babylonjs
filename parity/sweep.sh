# Because the Babylon candidate renders on the SAME WebGL2 driver (ANGLE/Metal) as the golden,
# parity is byte-EXACT: every graded effect passes at max-abs-diff 0. There is no per-effect
# relaxed-tolerance map: a 2026-07 full re-grade (every catalogued effect, including the
# continuous solvers reactionDiffusion/navierStokes evolved ~30s via the EVOLVE path) confirmed
# 0 diff across the board, including the handful of effects (newton, shadow, uvRemap,
# distortion, edge, pinch, crt) that once carried a relaxed tolerance here as a safety net — that
# net is retired; any non-zero diff now means a real BabylonBackend bug, not a rounding quirk.

# Documented skips: external-input effects ONLY — they need a MIDI/media/glyph source the parity

# is NOT skipped: its inputs are engine surfaces and it grades byte-identical via the std140 UBO
# path (the only "external" part is the zone-polygon config, which fills uniforms). media/text/roll
# DO numerically pass at max-abs-diff 0 on their fallback path (proving the base plumbing is
# correct on both backends) but stay policy-skipped: a pass here is necessary, not sufficient,
# evidence — it doesn't exercise the actual external-data upload (a real image/glyph atlas/MIDI
# stream), which the headless harness can't supply deterministically. Everything else is graded,
# including the continuous solvers AND the agent/points sims, all of which evolve to a
# bit-identical steady state (the EVOLVE map in render-batch.mjs runs them ~30s; the additive
# deposit blend is exact — raw blendFunc(ONE,ONE)).
