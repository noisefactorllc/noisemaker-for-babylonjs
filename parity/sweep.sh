# Because the Babylon candidate renders on the SAME WebGL2 driver (ANGLE/Metal) as the golden,
# parity is byte-tight: every effect passes at the strict default (max-diff <= 2.001), with
# NONE needing the per-effect relaxed tolerances the Metal-backed godot/td ports required. The
# relaxed map below is kept only as a safety net. The sole non-graded program is the continuous
# Gray-Scott solver reactionDiffusion (amplifies sub-ULP differences over its iteration loop —
# faithfully ported but not bit-reproducible across implementations; documented, skipped).
