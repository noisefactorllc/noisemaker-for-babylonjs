# noisemaker-babylon — Porting Guide

Unlike the Unity/Godot/TD ports, **there is no shader translation**: Babylon's WebGL2 path is
GLSL ES 3.00 with the same `gl_FragCoord` bottom-left origin as the reference, so effect shaders
are reused **verbatim** from `../noisemaker/shaders/effects/<ns>/<dir>/glsl/<program>.glsl`. The
work is making Babylon's `Effect`/`EffectRenderer` compile that raw GLSL pixel-exactly. The
hazards below were all load-bearing; each is handled once in `BabylonBackend`, not per effect.

## The five Babylon shader hazards (all fixed in `babylonBackend.js`)

1. **`#version 300 es` MUST be the first line.** Babylon's GLSL processor uses it to detect
   GLSL ES 3.00 and skip its ES1→ES3 migration. **90 of 247 reference shaders omit the version
   line** (the reference backend prepends it in `injectDefines`). Without it Babylon runs the
   migration on already-ES3 source (`out vec4`, `in`, `texture()`, `uvec3`, `floatBitsToUint`),
   which mangles the body → "Missing main()". Fix: strip any existing `#version` and prepend
   `#version 300 es` + `precision highp float;` + `precision highp int;` (PCG needs highp int).

2. **Don't use Babylon's default "postprocess" vertex** — it declares `uniform vec2 scale;`,
   which collides with effects that have their own `scale` uniform: *"Types of uniform 'scale'
   differ between VERTEX and FRAGMENT shaders."* Supply a custom minimal fullscreen vertex
   (`in vec2 position; gl_Position = vec4(position,0,1);`). Effects address pixels via
   `gl_FragCoord`, so no varying is needed.

3. **The version fix also prevents the `glFragColor` double-output.** For ES1-detected fragments
   Babylon injects `layout(location=0) out vec4 glFragColor;` *alongside* the shader's
   `out vec4 fragColor;` → *"must explicitly specify all locations when using multiple fragment
   outputs."* Taking the ES3 path (hazard 1) skips this injection.

4. **The reference `blit` program uses a `v_texCoord` varying** emitted by the reference vertex;
   Babylon's vertex doesn't supply it. Render blit passes with a `gl_FragCoord`/`texelFetch`
   copy instead (parity-equivalent for a same-size NEAREST blit). `BabylonBackend` skips
   compiling the reference `blit` and uses its own copy wrapper (pre-compiled in `init()`).

5. **`EffectRenderer.render` silently no-ops if the effect isn't ready.** Pre-compile every
   program and `await` readiness (`effect.isReady()`, polled) before the frame loop — otherwise a
   synchronous pass draws nothing and you get an all-zero (alpha 0) surface.

## Parity invariants (same as the WebGL2 reference)

- Render targets: linear **half-float RGBA** (`rgba16f`), **NEAREST** min/mag, **CLAMP_TO_EDGE**
  wrap, no hardware sRGB. Some internal temps are `rgba8` (per the effect's `textures` spec).
- Coordinate convention in every effect: `st = (gl_FragCoord.xy + tileOffset) / fullResolution.y`
  — divide by HEIGHT. Feed `time` **normalized 0..1**, `tileOffset=[0,0]`, `fullResolution=[w,h]`,
  `aspectRatio=w/h`, `renderScale=1`.
- `define`-params (`NOISE_TYPE`, `LOOP_OFFSET`) come from `program.defines`, injected as
  `#define`s via Babylon's `defines` option (NOT as uniforms — they have no `uniform` field).
- Uniform upload order: pass uniforms first, then global/system uniforms (skip names already set).
  Bind sampler inputs by name; `none`/missing → a 1×1 transparent-black texture.
- Per-effect helpers (`prng`, `periodicFunction`, `hsv2rgb`, `rotate2D`, distance metrics) are
  copied with each shader and differ between effects — only `pcg`/`map` are universal. PCG divisor
  is `4294967295.0`. (We reuse the files verbatim, so this is automatic.)

## Parity workflow

Goldens are reused from `../noisemaker-godot/parity/out` (byte-identical: same DSL × same
reference WebGL2 renderer). The candidate must render on the **same driver** as the golden:
headless Chromium with `--use-angle=metal` (a real GPU — `NullEngine` cannot render).

```bash
# one effect (renders Babylon candidate + grades vs reused golden)
NM_REFERENCE_ROOT=../noisemaker bash parity/run.sh noise

# full sweep (one browser for all 87 programs, then grade with the tolerance map)
NM_REFERENCE_ROOT=../noisemaker bash parity/sweep.sh

# render the candidate through the consumer host (NoisemakerRenderer) instead of the raw backend
NM_VIA_RENDERER=1 node parity/render-candidate.mjs noise
```

Readback matches the golden exactly: read the surface as float, quantize `round(v*255)` clamped
to 0..255, flip rows bottom-up→top-down. Result: **86/87 pass at strict `max-diff ≤ 2.001`**
(most byte-identical); `reactionDiffusion` is the documented continuous-solver skip.

## Adding the staged pass types

MRT (`pass.drawBuffers>1` / multiple `outputs`), `drawMode:'points'|'billboards'` (agent
deposit), and 3D volumes/meshes currently `console.warn` and skip in `executePass`. To add them,
mirror the corresponding `webgl2.js` branch on Babylon's `MultiRenderTarget` (MRT) /
`engine.bindFramebuffer` + a manual `engine.drawArrays`-equivalent for point/triangle draws, then
extend the parity corpus with the agent/3D programs.
